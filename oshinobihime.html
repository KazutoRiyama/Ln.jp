                <h2>Short review:</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>This is a classic, feel-good romantic comedy light novel (with a manga adaptation) that leans
                    heavily into sweet, fluffy "princess x ordinary guy" tropes. The story follows high
                    schooler Seito Kiriyama, who heroically rescues a beautiful girl named Luna from 
                    a kidnapping attempt during summer vacation. Turns out she's actually a refined, 
                    elegant princess from a foreign country sneaking out for some normal fun—and now 
                    she's basically half-living at his place, leading to cozy cohabitation antics.
                    <br><br>
                    The charm comes from the heavy flirting, lovey-dovey moments, and Luna's 
                    "only for you, Seito-sama~" devotion once she transfers to his school as an 
                    exchange student. It's packed with heartwarming romance, light humor from 
                    cultural clashes/secret identity stuff, and zero heavy drama—just pure sugar.
                    <br><br>
                    If you love low-stakes, wholesome romcoms like certain "saved the girl → she
                    clings forever" series (think echoes of "Otonari no Tenshi-sama" vibes but
                    with royalty), this delivers exactly that. It's not groundbreaking or deep,
                    but it's reliably cute and relaxing. Perfect for when you want zero stress
                    and maximum "aww" moments.
                    <br><br>
                    Rating vibe: 9/10 for fans of the genre; solid comfort read if you're into 
                    elegant princess waifus and sweet teasing.

                <p><br>
                    Like all of NekoKuro's light novels, this one is quite easy to read in 
                    Japanese. The main challenge here is the occasional use of "noble" 
                    vocabulary. The princess and her servant speak in keigo (polite/honorific 
                    language), which can be a bit complicated to follow at times, but otherwise,
                     it's a really straightforward and relaxing slice-of-life story to enjoy.
