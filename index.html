        <h2>Definition :</h2>
        <div class="definition">
        <p>Light novels (LNs) are a popular style of Japanese young adult novel fiction characterized by some manga-style illustrations, typically targeting teens and young adults, often serialized in anthologies or online before book publication, and frequently adapted into anime or manga series like That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or Re:ZERO. They're known for dense publishing schedules, specific formats (bunkobon), and a wide range of genres, with many popular series focusing on fantasy, Isekai (other worlds), and slice-of-life themes.</p>

        <h2>Why read in japanese ?</h2>
        <p>It is well known by now that the official translators claim themselves modifying the content they don't like.</p>
        <p>
            Reading light novels in their original language (AKA : japanese) rather than relying on english
             (or others) translations is because of how the format works, what get lost in translations, and the original
             raw experience it offers without censorships in any form, you get the story exactly like the authors intended. The 
             overall experience will feel way better even if you are only starting on your way to learning japanese.
        </p>
        <h2>6 main reasons :</h2>
        <h3>1. Getting the raw energy, rythm, and voice that translations flatten out</h3>
        <p>Light novels live or die on fast-paced, snappy internal monologues, exaggerated 
            reactions, rapid-fire banter, and that signature "tsukkomi" (straight-man retorts). 
            Japanese excels at this with short particles, repeated words for emphasis 
            (e.g., "いやいやいやいや待て待て待て！！"), casual slang like "マジかよ…", "クソがっ",
             or drawn-out ellipses「……はぁ」.<br>
            Professional English translations often smooth these into more natural-sounding
             English sentences → losing the chaotic, anime-like tempo and emotional punch. Reading 
             in Japanese feels much closer to hearing the voice actors in your head.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Access to modern, living Japanese slang and youth speech that rarely survives translations</h3>
        <p>Recent light novels (especially web-novel adaptations) are packed with current internet slang, Twitter/X-style abbreviations, otaku lingo, and casual grammar patterns that textbooks and news never teach.
        <br>Reading them immerses you in how actual young Japanese people text/speak/think right now → huge advantage if you want conversational fluency or to understand online Japanese communities. Translations usually "sanitize" or replace this with generic English teen-speak.
        </p>
        <h3>3. No censorships, no cuts, and the full unfiltered story</h3>
        <p>Series get tone down in English releases, especially violence, humor, sexual content, cultural references or the translators who add western politics 
            in fictional story who doesn't even have politics for theme. Official translators also translate every untranslatable words in every horrible possible ways.<br>
            Fans of japanese culture never had a problem keeping japanese terms before 'official' took away translations.
            A simple example is that in japanese, it's surname → name, wich bring enormous change when you decide
            to translate by name → surname. In Japan, you only call close people by their name, it changes the whole relationship
            to call someone by his first name, and the dynamic between the characters.
        </p>
        <h3>4. The "immersion high" and motivation boost is unmatched for learners</h3>
        <p>When the story clicks in Japanese and you laugh/cry/get hyped without a middleman, it creates powerful positive feedback: "I just read 300 pages in Japanese and it felt fun, not like homework."
            <br>This addictive loop keeps people reading thousands of pages → far more input than most structured study methods provide. Many learners report massive jumps in reading speed and intuition after pushing through the initial hard phase with light novels.
        </p>
        <h3>5. You experience nuances, wordplay, and cultural layers that are literally untranslatable</h3>
        <p>Puns based on kanji readings/homophones, deliberate misuse of polite vs rude speech for comedy, subtle shifts in pronouns/keigo to show relationships changing, onomatopoeia/giongo that carry emotion → a lot evaporates even in good translations.<br>
        Some highly praised Japanese works are considered "average" or "untranslatable" in English communities precisely because their charm relies on language tricks and rhythm.
        <br> The Gintama anime in a perfect example but had a really good fan translation in my native language (not english), with 
        the fan translator explaining the original japanese jokes at the top. Something we'll never see again with officials.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Perfect "extensive reading" ladder for Japanese learners</h3>
        <p>Many series have furigana (kana over kanji) → beginner/intermediate friendly. <br> 
        Genres range from very easy slice-of-life/comedy → gradually harder long-running epics or literary-leaning ones. <br>
        You can match your level : more advice on what to read in the light novel and learning japanese sections.<br>
        It's one of the few genres where you can read huge amounts for pleasure while leveling up naturally.</p>
        <h3>Bonus points</h3>
        <p>- it's cheap, like very cheap if you wait for promotions on Book Walker for example. (~24yens for big promo, up to ~500-600yens for little promo).<br>
        Normal price is ~800yens but most of the time in the 700yens. (3.82€, still three to four times cheaper).<br>
        - You can discuss with some authors on X, who generally respond to you, even with your broken japanese.
