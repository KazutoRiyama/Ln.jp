    <h1>Learning how to read japanese</h1>
            <div class="intro">
                <h2 id="kana">Kana</h2>
   
                <div class="intro-text-container">
                    <p>
                        The most important first step in learning Japanese is to memorize 
                        hiragana and katakana by heart.
                        (Quick note: I've chosen not to add an “s” to Japanese words like hiragana and katakana.)
                        Once you know them, in theory you can read everything written in Japanese — at least on a phonetic level. 
                        (More details about this later.)There are also many common combinations of kana (like small ゃ/ゅ/ょ, っ, or ん followed
                        by certain sounds), but they're quite intuitive. You don't really need to memorize them separately — you'll pick them 
                        up naturally just by reading.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3 id="hiragana">Hiragana:</h3>
                    <img src="resources/images/hiragana.png">

                    <h3 id="katakana">Katakana:</h3>
                    <img src="resources/images/katakana.png">
                    <p> Now you can read anything you want in Japanese!<br>This is thanks to <em>furigana</em> (also known as ruby text or yomigana), 
                        which consists of small kana (usually hiragana) printed above or beside kanji to show their pronunciation. 
                        It serves as a reading aid, especially helpful for children, language learners, and anyone unfamiliar with certain 
                        kanji.<br>Furigana is commonly used over every kanji in children's books. As the material becomes more advanced (aimed at 
                        older children or adults), fewer and fewer kanji get furigana. <br>But don't worry — this won't be a problem when reading on 
                        a computer. Many digital tools and apps can help display dictionnary for example to
                        look up unknown kanji instantly. (We'll cover how to use <em>Yomitan</em> — a simple, extremely helpful browser extension/tool — in more detail later.)
                        <br>Alternatively, when you encounter an unfamiliar kanji, you 
                        can simply check a dictionary. Japanese dictionaries typically list the kanji along with its furigana (hiragana reading) 
                        right next to it — and usually without <em>roumaji</em> (our Latin alphabet: a, b, c, etc.).

                <h2>Anki</h2>
                <h3>What's Anki ?</h3>
                <p>
                    Anki is a free, powerful, and widely used flashcard program (also called a spaced repetition system or SRS app) designed
                    to help you memorize and retain information long-term with minimal effort. It works by combining two key evidence-based 
                    techniques from cognitive science:<br>
                    - <em>Active recall</em>— instead of passively re-reading notes, you actively try to remember the answer before flipping the card 
                    (this strengthens memory far better than highlighting or re-reading).<br>
                    - <em>paced repetition</em> — the app uses a smart algorithm to schedule reviews at increasing intervals. Cards you find easy are 
                    shown less often (maybe weeks or months later), while difficult ones come back sooner — exactly when you're about to forget 
                    them. This fights the natural forgetting curve very efficiently.
                </p>

                <h3>Why is Anki especially popular for learning japanese?</h3>
                <p>
                    It's one of the most effective tools for mastering:<br>- <em>Hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em> (quick recognition drills)<br>
                    - <em>Kanji</em> (meanings, readings, stroke order, compounds)
                    <br>- <em>Vocabulary</em> (words in context, with audio/images if you want)
                    <br>- <em>Grammar</em> points and example sentences <br>
                    Huge communities share ready-made "decks" (sets of flashcards), like Core 2k/6k vocab, RTK (Remembering the Kanji), 
                    Tango N5-N1 series, or anime-sentence decks. You can download them for free from AnkiWeb and start immediately, or 
                    customize your own.
                </p>

                    <h3>How to install and setup Anki</h3>
                    <p>Start by downloading Anki by clicking on the official website by clicking on this 
                        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">link</a>.

                        Now, before we dive into the Anki application itself, let's start with the basics: how to add pre-made decks 
                        (especially shared ones from AnkiWeb) and later how to create your own decks from scratch.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="anki-presentation">How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are numerous pre-made decks available on <em>AnkiWeb</em> and elsewhere, so which one should you start with?
                        I recommend beginning with the one I personally started with (and many others swear by in 2026): <em>Kaishi 1.5k</em>
                         — a modern, highly regarded vocabulary deck designed specifically for beginners.

                                -  The <em>kanji</em> without <em>furigana</em>.<br>
                                -  A sentence including the <em>kanji</em> without <em>furigana</em>.

                                -  The <em>kanji</em> with <em>furigana</em>.<br>
                                - One of the possible translations (the deck often keeps only the most common or 
                                primary meaning, even though many Japanese words have multiple nuances or uses).<br>
                                - The sentence including the <em>kanji</em> with <em>furigana</em>. <br>
                                - The sentence translation. <br>
                                - An audio including the <em>kanji</em> pronunciation and the sentence pronunciation.<br>

                        There are 4 buttons at the bottom, but basically only 2 are useful:<br><br>
                        - <em>Again</em>: <u>useful</u>.<br>
                        Press this button when you don't know (or are unsure of) the answer. <br>
                        It will show you the card again in under 1 minute (by default), giving you a quick chance 
                        to try again right away.For new cards, you'll typically need to guess correctly twice in a
                         row (on first appearance) before the card moves out of the "learning" phase and into 
                         the longer spaced-repetition intervals.<br><br>
                         - <em>Hard</em>: <u>Basically useless</u>.<br>
                        This button has the same basic function as the "Again" button. <br>it tells Anki that you didn't know the 
                        answer well enough — but instead of showing the card again in under 1 minute, it schedules the card 
                        to reappear the next day.In other words:  Pressing Hard (on a new card in the learning phase) delays 
                        the next review until tomorrow, rather than forcing an immediate retry refraining your learning process.<br><br>
                        - <em>Good</em>: <u>Useful</u>.<br>
                        Usually moves the card forward to 10 minutes later (on first appearance), then longer if you 
                        keep getting it right the next days.<br><br>
                        - <em>Easy</em>: <u>Rarely useful</u>.<br>
                        Skips some early steps and jumps the card straight to longer spaced intervals. Useful when you 
                        start a new deck and already know the kanji.

                    <h3 id="decks">Adding existing decks</h3>
                    <p>Here's a clear, step-by-step guide on how to add a deck to Anki (focusing on the most common case: adding a 
                        shared/pre-made deck from AnkiWeb, like Kaishi 1.5k or any other popular one). This works the same in 2026 
                        as in recent versions — Anki hasn't changed the core process much.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 1: Find and Download the Deck</h4>
                    <p>1. Open your web browser (on computer, phone, or tablet) and go to:
                        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/" target="_blank">https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/</a><br>
                        2. Search for the deck you want (e.g., type "Kaishi 1.5k" or "Japanese vocabulary").<br>
                        3. When you find it, click the Download button.  This downloads a file ending in .apkg (Anki Package) 
                        — usually to your Downloads folder.<br><br>
                        <em>Important note</em>: You cannot add shared decks directly through the AnkiWeb website online account. You must
                         import the .apkg file into the Anki app first (desktop, Android, or iOS), then sync if you want
                          it on other devices.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 2: Import the Deck into Anki</h4>
                    <p>
                        Choose your platform — desktop is easiest for beginners and first-time setup.<br>
                        <em>On computer</em> - recommended.<br>
                        1. Download and install Anki (naviguate to setup if not already done).<br>
                        2. Find the downloaded .apkg file in your Downloads folder and double-click it.
                        Anki should automatically open and start the import.<br>
                        3. Anki may show a quick confirmation dialog (e.g., about note types or scheduling) — 
                        usually just click Import or accept defaults.<br>
                        4. Done! The new deck(s) will appear in your main Decks screen.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 3: Sync accross devices (optionnal but recommended)</h4>
                    <p>
                        1. In Anki (any platform), click the Sync button (cloud icon, usually top right; or press Y on desktop).<br>
                        2. Log in with your free AnkiWeb account if prompted (create one at ankiweb.net if you don't have it).<br>
                        3. Choose Upload if this is your first sync (sends decks to the cloud), or Download if pulling from elsewhere.<br>
                        4. Now the deck is available on all your devices after syncing!
