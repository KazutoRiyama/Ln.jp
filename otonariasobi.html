                <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
                <p><br>One day, a foreign exchange student was transfered in Aoyagi Akito's class.
                     Her name is Charlotte Bennett. Everyone is immediately attracted by a pure and 
                     innocent personnality, her refined demeanor and her cuteness. But, with calm, 
                     Akito just think 'we live in different worlds' and stay away. However, when he 
                     helps his little sister Emma who was lost, Akito's life took a dramatic turns. 
                     Akito finds out that the Bennet sisters live in the appartment next door, and 
                     because Emma took a liking to him, they suddenly started coming over in his 
                     appartment almost every day. The three of them play, eat dinner and go out 
                     together. As they spend time together, Akito and Charlotte naturally grow close, 
                    albeit akwardly. - the start of a sweet and frustrating love comedy next door!</p>

                <h2>Short review:</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>This is peak healing romance with heavy sibling-flavored domestic bliss. If you like 
                    series where the biggest conflict is "should we hold hands today?" or "Emma wants
                     ice cream again," this delivers in spades. It's not trying to reinvent the 
                     wheel — it's just very good at spinning that wheel smoothly and adorably. 
                    <br><br>
                    Charlotte and Emma are an unbeatable duo. Charlotte is the elegant, slightly clumsy British exchange student
                     beauty who's surprisingly down-to-earth once she warms up, while little Emma is an absolute cinnamon roll of
                      a imouto character—energetic, affectionate, and the perfect catalyst for forcing the MC and older sister into 
                      proximity. Their interactions feel genuinely warm and family-like without being forced.
                    <br><br>
                    low-burn but consistent progress. The protagonist (Aoyagi Akihito) starts off as a somewhat self-sacrificing 
                    loner type, but the daily visits erode his walls naturally. By mid-series volumes, there's real emotional depth—past
                     family issues for both sides get explored lightly but meaningfully, adding just enough substance so it doesn't feel
                      completely brain-off fluff.
                    <br><br>
                    Zero toxicity. No dramatic love triangles, no annoying rivals that overstay their welcome, no contrived 
                    drama. It's refreshingly wholesome for a harem-adjacent setup (though it's mostly focused on the two 
                    sisters + MC).
                    <br><br>
                    Rating vibe: 8/10 for fans of the genre; solid comfort read if you're into imou/ane, imou/onii combo and romance
                    stories.

                <h2>More details on reading in japanese:</h2>
                <p><br>It's a very easy read. The combination of slice-of-life and a little girl makes it even easier. 
                    Slice-of-life is already one of the easiest genres to read, and adding a child makes it even more 
                    approachable. The most difficult part is probably the discussion between the main character and his
                     best friend. Otherwise, if you're not yet familiar with Japanese, it can sometimes be a bit hard to 
                     understand Emma at first — she obviously talks like a young child and mispronounces words in a cute way.</p>
