                     I, Nukumizu Kazuhiko am a mob character in class. One day I witnessed Yanami Anna, a popular girl, getting rejected by a boy.<br> 
                     <span class="italic">"He said he would make me his wife, isn't that heartless?"</span> <br>
                     <span class="italic">"That, how old were you when it happened?"</span><br>
                     <span class="italic">"4 or 5 years old."</span><br>
                       That doesn't count.<br>
                        This leads to the emergence of a group of girls who feel defeated, Yakishio Lemon from the track and 
                       field club and Komari Chika from the literature club..? <br>
                       <span class="italic">"Nukumizu-kun, girls are divided into two types: childhood friends and homewrecker"</span><br>

                         Only after being defeated will these shining girls be happy. Unveil the story of losing heroines and their mysterious youth.</p>

                <h2>Short review:</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>The premise brilliantly subverts rom-com tropes: Nukumizu witnesses classmate Anna Yanami's public rejection, then gets 
                    roped into supporting her, athletic Lemon Yakishio, and shy literature club member Chika Komari through their romantic woes. 
                    Episodes revolve around episodic "losing heroine" arcs, blending laugh-out-loud comedy with surprisingly mature explorations
                     of rejection, self-worth, and moving on. 
                    <br><br>
                    It's hilarious in its self-awareness—poking fun at childhood friend zones and track star crushes—yet heartfelt, showing realistic 
                    teen emotions without preachiness. The lack of romance for the MC keeps it grounded, emphasizing friendship over fantasy.
                    <br><br>
                    The cast shines. Nukumizu is an everyman we root for—awkward but kind. Anna's bubbly energy, Lemon's tomboy charm, 
                    and Chika's introverted cuteness create dynamic chemistry. Side characters add flavor without overcrowding.
                    <br><br>
                    This is a classic harem-style light novel that starts slowly, with no real romance developing between the main character (MC)
                     and the female leads for a very long time—it's very much a slow-burn story. However, we all know how these things usually go:
                      in the end, all the girls who get rejected by others will likely end up falling for the MC.The characters are all interesting 
                      and have very distinct personalities. There's absolutely no boredom whatsoever in the dialogues or the overall story.The MC's 
                      little sister adds some extra spice to the narrative with her strong brocon (brother-complex) tendencies.
                      <br>(Quick note: While the series does lean into harem-like dynamics as it progresses—with the girls growing closer to the
                       MC and showing increasing interest—the core focus remains more on friendship, emotional support, and the "losing heroines"
                        moving on from heartbreak rather than rushing into full romance (at least at the moment, after reading 7 volumes). The 
                        little sister's brocon side is toned down in adaptations like the anime, but it's more prominent in the light novels.)
                    <br><br>
                    Rating vibe: 9.5/10 for fans of the genre; Makeine is a breath of fresh air in a trope-saturated genre—funny, emotional, 
                    and relatable. And it's actually one of the most popular light novels right now, consistently ranking as a top-seller 
                    with each new release.
